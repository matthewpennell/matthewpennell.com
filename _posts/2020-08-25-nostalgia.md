I'm starting to realise that quite a lot of the things that I thought I wanted to create are, in fact, rooted in nostalgia and not passion. Subjects that I was interested in years (if not decades) ago stubbornly remain on my bucket list, even though it should be clear to even the most casual observer that I have very little genuine interest in those subjects any more. Z80 assembler programming? D&D sourcebooks? Podcasts? They wouldn't make any lists of my favourite things, if I'm being honest.

So when I look over my list of potential side-projects and consider which of them correlate with the actual areas I am still motivated to explore—the topics I actually demonstrate passion for—it's the same old set of interests. Literary fiction. Film. Music. These are the artforms I seek out and enjoy the most, the ones I want to understand more deeply, embracing both theory and practice. And therefore, if I do truly want to dedicate spare time to "making stuff" instead of simple mindless consumption, it is those activities where I should invest my time and energy.

All of which is to say, in a roundabout way, that I think I'm going to start writing again.
