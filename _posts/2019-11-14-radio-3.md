When I'm driving, if I don't have one Spotify playlist or another plugged in, I'm a BBC Radio 4 kinda guy. Whether it's _Today_ during my morning commute, or _PM_ in the evenings, I enjoy the more in-depth news journalism they offer over the banter- and personality-driven Radios 1 or 2. Or, in the very early mornings, when they broadcast the BBC World Service, there's the possibility of catching a programme on any number of extraordinary, eye-opening topics.

But this week, for a change &mdash; or perhaps because there's only so much Brexit-related election coverage one can stomach &mdash; I instead tuned into Radio 3, the BBC's classical music station, and enjoyed several hours of news-free, politics-free music. It helped that they just so happened to be playing some of my favourite pieces of music, Liszt's _Hungarian Rhapsodies_ and Copland's _Appalachian Spring Suite_ among them, but it's nice to switch off your awareness of the world's problems for a little while, and just enjoy beauty. I really must make the effort to listen to more classical music.
