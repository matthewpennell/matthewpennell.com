Why is there no physical social media? Updating your current status online, across myriad platforms, has become such an intrinsic part of modern life but I find it curious that nobody yet seems to be interested in bringing that information offline and into the physical world.

Why are there no badges that reflect your current mood, or hats that display the song you're currently listening to? We have digital photo frames in our homes, but no digital photos on tote bags or car windows. And people will decorate their avatars with _in memoriam_ frames or political protest banners, but very few are willing to wear any visible indication of sentiment or belief beyond an occasional red poppy.
