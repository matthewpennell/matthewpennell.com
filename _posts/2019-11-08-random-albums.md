As an enthusiastic music buyer, almost all of the albums in my collection were purchased for one specific reason &mdash; because I liked the band or artist, and wanted to own their work. In most cases, I can pinpoint the moment that led me to pick up a favourite album, or turned me on to a new artist &mdash; the worn-out Queen tape that my parents would listen to on long car journeys; the Prince album that my first girlfriend would play all the time; the support band that a friend told me I "probably wouldn't like" but would become my favourite band for the next thirty years.

However, there are a very small number of CDs that came to me via other routes. There were free cover discs on magazines, of course, but I'm talking in this case about albums that I bought with no prior knowledge of either the album or the band. For example, I picked up _Modified_, the second album by Californian ska-punks Save Ferris, flipping though the racks in a record store on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, and I chose it purely because of the band's movie-inspired name. It wasn't a genre I'd ever really paid attention to before, and I can't say it ever became a favourite, but I certainly listened to it a fair few times over the years.

My most unintentional purchase, though, has to be R.E.M's _New Adventures In Hi-Fi_, which like a lot of people my age I acquired simply because I forgot to cancel the monthly subscription to the Britannia Music Club. BMC was a mail-order company that hooked you with an initial offer of cheap CDs for a pound, then relied on either your love of PolyGram's back catalogue &mdash; or more often your own forgetfulness &mdash; to roll that subscription over into a stream of full-price CDs.

Although I'd obviously heard of R.E.M. before, I was never really a fan, my exposure mostly being through friends listening to throwaway pop like _Shiny Happy People_, but _New Adventures In Hi-Fi_ was actually a bit of a revelation. Muddy, distorted rock songs like _The Wake-Up Bomb_ sit alongside acoustic alt-country like the almost-spoken word track, _E-Bow The Letter_. Listening to it gave me a new appreciation for the band, and prompted me to go back and check out their older releases like _Murmur_, _Fables of the Reconstruction_ and probably my favourite of their first few albums, _Life's Rich Pageant_.

Serendipity can be weird sometimes.
