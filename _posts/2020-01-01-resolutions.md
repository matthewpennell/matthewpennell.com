I wasn't sure whether I'd even put up a New Year's Resolutions post this year, after I nuked my old blog some time towards the beginning of 2019. That, plus the disavowing of all of my old ambitious creative projects (when I finally realised they weren't actually what I wanted to do with my life) had me thinking I'd have nothing to say on January 1st.

But, since starting to blog again on this reworked site in November, I find that I do actually have a couple of things that you could consider to be resolutions for 2020, so I might as well post them in order to keep myself honest and continue the tradition (albeit a tradition that you can now only find via archive.org).

There are two things I want to accomplish this year (well, technically one to accomplish and one to avoid):

1. **Get better at graphic design.** As I [wrote about recently](https://matthewpennell.com/2019-12-22), I feel like my lack of natural artistic ability is a hindrance in my professional life. While there isn't actually a lot of graphic design work necessary in my day-to-day, I'd really like to fill that gap in my skillset with a better appreciation for layout, typography, colour choices, and so on, and the ability to execute the same. I'm going to enroll in a Coursera specialisation today. Maybe I'll even start posting on Dribbble again, who knows.

2. **Stay off Twitter.** I spent six months away from Twitter before going back to the site in mid-2019, but since the UK election cycle the site has become simply unbearable once more. It's no longer a place to keep up with what your friends, acquaintances, and favourite celebrities are up to; instead, the Twitter algorithm seems hell-bent on putting the most frustrating or upsetting content in front of you. However, I've realised that being aware of the anti-left, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-whatever offensive moron of the day really brings me nothing but anxiety. I can do nothing about it besides be annoyed at how many stupid people there are in the world, and so I'd really be better off without it. Truly newsworthy stories will filter up to the real world; from now on, the Twitter outrage generator can feed itself without my help.
