The weather has changed in the last week or so. From late October's balmy, near t-shirt weather, with temperatures in the mid-teens, early November seems to have decided that it's about time for winter, and it has reminded me how much I genuinely enjoy running in the wind and rain.

There's something primal about being exposed to the elements with what feels like only the heat from your own muscles keeping you alive in the face of the driving, icy rain, as the water runs down your face and plasters your thin shirt to your frozen chest. Somehow you can run faster, further than normal, those few degrees making the difference between breathless sweating effort and magical, effortless, flowing speed.
