I think it's something like the fifteenth year in a row that I've written this review of my last year of media consumption, which is close to being the longest I've ever stuck with any habit. What always surprises me is that, no matter how assiduously I record my reading, listening and watching habits, there are always surprises when I come to perform this annual look back; books I don't remember reading, films I can't recall at all, and artists that I would never have guessed I listened to enough to put them into any top ten list.

## Reading

Just as in 2020, my book count is far lower than in earlier years due to the lack of time I'm now spending in airports, on planes, and in hotels. I said last year that I really should try to read more during the day (since generally I only read in bed); sadly I didn't make any progress with that particular resolution. Maybe next year.

I've always split these lists into fiction, non-fiction, and comic books:

### Fiction

* Horus Rising (Dan Abnett)
* All the Light We Cannot See (Anthony Doerr)
* The Last Tycoon (F. Scott Fitzgerald)
* The Gum Thief (Douglas Coupland)
* The Stainless Steel Rat (Harry Harrison)
* Coot Club (Arthur Ransome)
* A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole)
* Shooting Martha (David Thewlis)
* The Pursuit of the Pankera (Robert A. Heinlein)
* The Trouble with Peace (Joe Abercrombie)
* Podkayne of Mars (Robert A. Heinlein)
* The Lord of the Rings (J.R.R. Tolkien)
* Jurassic Park (Michael Crichton)
* Skavenslayer (William King)
* Between Planets (Robert A. Heinlein)
* The Bone Clocks (David Mitchell)
* Of Human Bondage (W. Somerset Maugham)
* Trollslayer (William King)
* The Three-Body Problem (Cixin Liu)
* Pigeon Post (Arthur Ransome)

A pretty unimpressive list, all told - a lot of pulp and re-reads with only a couple of truly memorable books. _All the Light We Cannot See_ was excellent (as you'd expect of a Pulitzer winner), but Maugham's _Of Human Bondage_ was far and away the best thing I read this year and I'd recommend it to everyone. I also re-read _The Lord of the Rings_ for the first time in ages - I'd forgotten how good it was - while at the other end of the spectrum I was disappointed by how uninteresting _The Three-Body Problem_ turned out to be, after seeing it mentioned in so many people's lists of their favourite novels.

### Non-fiction

* In Patagonia (Bruce Chatwin)
* More Than a Woman (Caitlin Moran)
* Atomic Habits (James Clear)
* ZX Spectrum Basic Programming (Steven Vickers)
* Dogs Bark, but the Caravan Rolls On (Frank Conroy)
* Stop-Time (Frank Conroy)
* Tarantino: A Retrospective (Tom Shone)

Despite not being in her target audience, I really enjoyed Caitlin Moran's _More Than a Woman_, and _Atomic Habits_ is a very helpful book if you're trying to start or stop any behaviour in your own life, but any year I re-read _Stop-Time_ nothing else can come close to being my favourite. The Tarantino book was a Christmas present last year; I still have a similarly huge book on PT Anderson to tackle.

### Comics

* Providence (Alan Moore)
* It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken (Seth)
* The Poor Bastard (Joe Matt)
* The Ballad of Halo Jones (Alan Moore)
* Ghost World (Daniel Clowes)

Most years there's not much variety in the comics I get through, but this time around Alan Moore is joined by some other notables from the 1990s independent comic scene. After re-reading Joe Matt, I realised that I'd never actually read any of Seth's Palookaville strip; _It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken_ was a great introduction to his work.

## Listening

Again, just as with my literary choices, I seem to be drawn more to old favourites these days than new music. I often tend to spend a whole day with just one artist, listening to their entire back catalogue; I think there is safety in nostalgia during the uncertain times in which we live.

### Top 10 artists in 2021

1. Still Corners
2. The Weather Station
3. The New Pornographers
4. Radiohead
5. The Wildhearts
6. Weezer
7. Julien Baker
8. REM
9. Guns N' Roses
10. The Beatles

The top two released my two favourite albums of 2021 (see below), but almost everyone else on this list is just one of my favourite bands. I don't even remember listening to that much New Pornographers or Guns N' Roses, yet somehow they both made the top ten.

### Top 10 albums in 2021

1. The Last Exit - Still Corners
2. Ignorance - The Weather Station
3. Little Oblivions - Julien Baker
4. Catspaw - Matthew Sweet
5. On All Fours - Goat Girl
6. Super Monster - Claud
7. Magic Mirror - Pearl Charles
8. Home - Rhye
9. Collapsed in Sunbeams - Arlo Parks
10. Run the Jewels 3 - Run the Jewels

All new releases aside from RTJ, although those released earlier in the year like Rhye, Pearl Charles and Matthew Sweet edged out several albums that I actually preferred from the latter half of 2021 like those by Manchester Orchestra, Spellling, and Chloe Moriondo.

As was the case in last year's post, I'm only listing here the films that I first saw in 2021. It's a mixture of the best stuff from the last couple of years that I hadn't yet got around to watching (_Uncut Gems_, _Nomadland_, _Parasite_, _Sound of Metal_, _Mank_) plus a handful of cinema visits with the kids (_In The Heights_, _Dune_, _Spider-Man: No Way Home_), and then a few random picks of things I'd always meant to get around to watching but never found the time.

In general I found the Netflix exclusives pretty underwhelming: _Don't Look Up_, _Army of the Dead_, and _Mank_ were all disappointing. The best things I watched this year were, unsurprisingly, those movies that everyone can't believe you've never seen; _Galaxy Quest_ was perfect satire, _Death Proof_ finally completed my Tarantino collection, and _Malcolm X_ somehow made a three-and-a-half hour film seem like it was over too soon.
