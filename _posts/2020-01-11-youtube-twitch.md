So far in 2020, I'm happy to say, I've managed to stay away from Twitter, and I feel much less stressed as a result. But without that reliable time-suck I now find I need something else to fill those moments when you don't feel like doing anything that's actually productive, and so I've been spending a lot more time on both YouTube and Twitch in the last couple of weeks.

## YouTube

My YouTube subscriptions are becoming a pretty accurate cross-section of my interests. I've always watched channels on film or script analysis, like [Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A) or the excellent [Notes from the Screenplay](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErSSa3CaP_GJxmFpdjG9Jw), but I've added more to that list recently such as the SFX-focused [Corridor Crew](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSpFnDQr88xCZ80N-X7t0nQ), and [Thomas Flight](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyvQV2JsICeLZP4c_h40kA), who makes detailed analysis videos looking at various aspects of movie-making. I'm also kind of addicted to [Screen Junkies](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpcACMWblDls9Z6GERVi1A)' _Honest Trailers_ series.

On the gaming side, I follow a few experts on particular games that I'm playing (or have played in the past); right now that means [PartyElite](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg3BiSs8eBE9hA9EWYTgtAg) for his Total War videos, [TheLazyPeon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE-f0sqi-H7kuLT0YiW9rcA) for general MMO news, and a couple of random World of Warcraft and Age of Empires II channels.

Then there's [TwoSetViolin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzKFALPuF_EPe-AEI0WFFw) (a couple of dorky violin pros making funny violin-themed reaction videos), [theneedledrop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt7fwAhXDy3oNFTAzF2o8Pw) (music reviews), [Seth James DeMoor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeSHo5kTvzoik4STh7MuMCA) (running) and [David Bennet Piano](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz2iUx-Imr6HgDC3zAFpjOw) (more music analysis) among others. I spent years just browsing YouTube at random, and it's really only in the last year or two that I've started actually subscribing to channels; I kind of wish I started doing it sooner, as their recommendation algorithm is pretty good at surfacing new things that I'm genuinely interested in watching.

## Twitch

While I have no real desire to ever be a streamer, I've finally started to actually watch other people stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) occasionally. While I find the big streamers like Asmongold to be abrasive and juvenile simply for the sake of growing an audience of teenaged boys (and a chatroom with fifty thousand people in it is so far beyond usable that it's simply not funny), it's actually quite relaxing to dig into the tail-end of the streamer lists and find someone streaming to just a handful of viewers. Genuine conversations with strangers over the internet seems so much more normal when you bond over a shared love for a game, rather than in the artificial social interaction of a site like Chat Roulette.
