Here are a couple of clever logos that passed by my Twitter stream in the last few days.

First, a pet store logo containing both a bird and a dog in a simple cartoon line drawing, by [Lumo](http://golumo.com/):

![Feathurs and Fur logo](/i/feathers.jpg)

And second, another smart and simple logo for a golf course, by [lexlogo](http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/91660). Unfortunately this one isn't for a real business (yet):

The ability to find and exploit these hidden dual aspects of a shape or wordmark is the sign of a truly talented logo designer.

(Plenty more around the web, such as [these ones on Twisted Sifter](http://twistedsifter.com/2011/08/20-clever-logos-with-hidden-symbolism/).)
