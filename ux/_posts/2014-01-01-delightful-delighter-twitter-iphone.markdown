The official Twitter app for iOS is generally pleasurable to use, particularly since it aims to facilitate such a wide variety of user behaviour (updates, conversations, discovery, activity by your friends, notifications).

One lovely hidden touch I only recently discovered is the interaction when pulling down on an individual user's profile picture. There is nothing above that element, so you might imagine that nothing happens aside from the page springing back up when you let go --- but the developers have actually added a nice little zoom-and-blur effect to add that little extra visual flair to the interface.

On your own profile page, this action also reveals the other Twitter accounts set up on the device, and allows you to add a new account or quickly switch between your accounts. (You can access the same list by holding down the 'Me' button for a couple of seconds.)

This kind of hidden, discoverable interaction, particularly on areas of functionality not used by the majority of users, is lovely to come across, and really emphasises the attention to detail of these top companies and their designers.
